<h3>Descripton</h3>
<p>
    Yuzu is a delicious Japanese citrus fruit. 
    It is slightly sour with a touch of sweetness.
    A very refreshing fruit, its perfect as a pick-me-up for breakfast.
    Yuzu maramlade is best eaten morning lunch and dinner.
    A jar of yuzu marmalade is paired well with a fresh loaf of french toast for a midnight study snack. Ok maybe not a entire jar of marmalade, but you almost could when this jam is so magically tasty.
    We will not judge you. 
    Even if you are a bear.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>7 small yuzu</li>
    <li>1 large lemon</li>
    <li>2 cups of water</li>
    <li>5 cups of sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teasooon salted butter</li>
    <li>1 package fruit pectin</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Mix yuzu peels, water, in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Add yuzu juice. Cover and simmer for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
<li>
    Measure exactly 4 cups of the yuzu juice mixture into a separate pot. If you are a little short because yuzu juice is hard to extract in the first place, add water to make up for the amount that is missing.
</li>
<li>
    Stir pectin into the pot and add butter to reduce foaming. Bring the mixture to a full rolling boil-one that does not stop bubbling when stirred. Stir constantly. Add sugar and return to a rolling boil while stirring constantly. Boil for exactly 1 minute. Remove from heat. Skim any and all foam off with a metal spoon.
</li>
<li>Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area. May take up to 2 weeks to set.</li>
